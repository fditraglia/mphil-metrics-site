This is the website for my lectures as part of the first-year MPhil Econometrics course at Oxford. Click on the navigation menu at the bottom of the page to access lecture notes, videos, references, etc. For more information about me and my research, visit my [personal website](https://ditraglia.com). I post occasional notes on econometrics and statistics at [econometrics.blog](https://econometrics.blog).
