title = "Limited Dependent Variables Syllabus: HT 2020"
+++

My lectures on limited dependent variables and sample selection are scheduled for weeks 1 and 2 of HT 2020. Due to current government restrictions, these will take place remotely. I will provide pre-recorded videos for you to watch in lieu of the regularly-scheduled Monday and Wednesday class meetings. On Fridays from 8:30-10am I will conduct a live Q&A over Zoom. Login details will be posted on canvas along with recordings of the Q&A sessions for students who are unable to attend. Topics for each week are listed below. Details of what to read/watch in advance of each Friday Q&M session will be added here soon.
