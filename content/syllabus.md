+++

My lectures on limited dependent variables and sample selection are scheduled for weeks 1 and 2 of HT 2021. Due to current government restrictions, these will take place remotely. I will provide pre-recorded videos for you to watch in lieu of the regularly-scheduled Monday and Wednesday class meetings. On Fridays from 9:00-10:30am I will conduct a live Q&A over Zoom. Login details will be posted on canvas along with recordings of the Q&A sessions for students who are unable to attend. Topics for each week are listed below. 

## HT Week 1
* Lecture 1: Maximum Likelihood under Mis-specification
    - Read: Lecture Notes Chapter 1
    - Watch: [Poisson MLE](https://expl.ai/CHAKTHR), [The Kullback-Leibler Divergence](https://expl.ai/REZKTJY), [Asymptotics for Mis-specified MLE](https://expl.ai/MRVFZMR), [Asymptotic Variance Calculations for Poisson MLE](https://expl.ai/TZBUFGU), and [The Information Matrix Equality](https://expl.ai/MDCWESE)
* Lecture 2: Poisson Regression
* Lecture 3: Models for Binary Outcomes
* [Problem Set #1](/ps1.pdf)

## HT Week 2
